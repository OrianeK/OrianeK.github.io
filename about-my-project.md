## About My Project

Robot Autonomy

Problem: 
  - Most semi-autonomous wheelchairs are for individual use, not a large-scale public format 
  - Others have not yet created a program that is capable of full autonomy in         bringing an individual to a customized location 
  - There is currently no track-based autonomous wheelchair on the market
  - Navigating from an airport gate from ticketing, through crowds, without additional user inputs will be a significant step forward 


Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Completing LiDAR SLAM implementation for autonomous navigetion
  - Completing Visual SLAM implementation for autonomous navigetion

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference Paper and presentation at the end of the CEAMLS program. The presentation will focus on the using SLAM and trackbased navigation systems for autonomous navigation.
