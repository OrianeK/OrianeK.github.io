   We didn't do any actual research but I got to learn a lot from the bootcamp that were held over the week which I'll consider an accomplisment
## Results Achieved 
   I gained a greater understanding in all the subjects that were coverd over the course of this week
## Algorithms Used 
   We used logistics regression model to train data during the machine learning bootcamp this week. We also covered numpy and pandas to work with data sets provided
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   I encountered some issues with remembering all the information that was provided this as it was a lot but with repetition and prpactice I cannot imagine that becoming an obstacle.
## Other Relevnat Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   I got to discuss the project I would be working on with my mentors over the course of this internship program and got aquainted with tools like python which will be of crucial importance in understanding and positively contributing to my project.
