## Accomplishments
   This week was mainly last adjustments and presentations. The paper was completed and all deliverables submitted
## Results Achieved 
   I was able to present in front of people and to my suprise it got easier than the first time. I was also able to submit the paper and all my other deliverables.
## Algorithms Used 
   This week no algorithms were used as I was mainly working on my delivrables for the institute.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   No issues or frustrations this week. all I really did was present and submit my deliverable but if I had to include and issue it would be the stress of presenting. although it gets better it still is hard lto do public speaking
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   This week I learned that the more you  present the less stressful it gets so I'll keep practicing that.
