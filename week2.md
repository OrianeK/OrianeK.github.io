## Accomplishments
   This week I got to accomplish a few things. I got to learn how to use the opencv python library, ultralytics library and yolo algorithm and run a few object detection programs.
## Results Achieved 
   Using the Opencv and ultralytics python libraries I got to learn how to run labelled object detection programs. I was also able to see first hand how useful the implementation of the yolo algorithm couldd be through the implementation of said programs.
## Algorithms Used 
   This week we used the Yolo algorithm to run a labelled object detection program. It was really interesting to see how that algorithm improved the previous object detection programs I got to run seing how boxed the objects and labelled them each in real time with the help of opencv and ultralytics libraries.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   I encountered a few Frustrating issue. The first one was during the set up of my raspberrypi. I didn't realise until my team mate told me, that I was supposed to conect my mouse's usb connector to the raspberrypi board instead of the monitor.
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   Outside of the skill aquisition majority section of the week I got to do some robot automy research to understand what the methods we were using in the applicaiton of this research was and why we are using them. I also got to explore other forms of applications for the research we are doing through other people's research and other online resources.
