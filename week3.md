## Accomplishments
   This week I got familiar with SLAM and Automated Systems. I also tried to double boot Ubuntu and Installed a virtual machine onto my laptop.
## Results Achieved 
   There are no delivrables so to speak this week. Instead, I gained a greater understanding of systems used in robot navigation such as ROS2 
## Algorithms Used 
  This week was more of a learning week to get more familiar with the systems that are to be used later on so there were no algorithms put to use.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   One issue I faced this week was double booting with Ubuntu. I tried double booting Ubuntu onto my laptop and everything was going fine up until the point where it was time to install the Ubuntu 22.04 version which is not compatible with the M-chips for macs and is the only version compatible with ROS2. I might either have to run that version od Ubuntu on my virtual machine or run it on a different machine intirely but the latter seems more likely given that the virtual machine might cause some network delays
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   Reading the documentation for this project and related research, I've braodened my area of knowledge which makes understanding what we're working on much easier giving me the ability to contribute more to the project.
