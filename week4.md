## Accomplishments
   This week I got to install ROS2 on my virtual machine using the provided documentation and I also Learned the use of the individual parts consisting of the LIDAR based SLAM robot
through the process of disassembling and assembling it.
## Results Achieved 
   There are no delivrables so to speak this week. Instead, I gained a greater understanding of the individual parts consistngof the LIDAR-based SLAM robot.
## Algorithms Used 
  This week I had more interactions with the hardware side of the project except for the installation of ROS2 on my virtual machine, so I did no tuse any algorithms.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   One issue I faced this week was installing ROS2 following the instructions on the documentation. I ran into a difficult situation when the installation instructions gave me errors on the terminal of my virtual machine so i tried to troubleshoot using chat GPT which helped find why I was getting an Error and fix it.
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   I got to visit NASA for the first time and I found the work they were doing at their facilities very interesting. It broadened my understanding of where and how my skills could be applied and the intersectionality between various disciplines
