## Accomplishments
   This week I got into a lot of harware issues which made me unable to get a mapping of the room  but I was able to atleast to run SLAM mapping using LIDAR. 
## Results Achieved 
   This week I was able to run SLAM mappign using LIDAR which completes the LIDAR SLAM documentation.
## Algorithms Used 
  This week I had more interactions with the hardware side of the project except for the installation of ROS2 on my virtual machine, so I did no tuse any algorithms.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   This week I had a lot of hardware issues. My waveshare board and/or my motors are not working properly so my robot cannot navigate where it is directed to. Only one of my wheels is working which makes it imposibble for the robot to cover any significant distance which in turns also makes me unable to succesfully get a map of a room. The mapping was supposed to be the main deliverable for this week but due to those issue that has been postponed till new parts arrive.
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   I got to learn a lot from the demo proffessor scott gave us on the vissual SLAM which we're supposed to start next week. It also is very interesting to see how big a part trouble shooting plays in the completion of this project.
