## Accomplishments
   This week too I got a couple of issues with the hardware implementations of my project but I also got to solve the some of the others I had from last week. I got to fix the navigation hardware issue of my robot through trouble shooting and Research and understand visual SLAM foreshadowing future implementation. 
## Results Achieved 
   Since I was able to solve the navigation issue of my robot, I was able to manually drive it around my workspace room with no issues. 
## Algorithms Used 
   I haven't gotten to use the SLAM algorithm yet but I am building up to that pretty consistently.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   This week I tried getting more into the SLAM algorithm since I managed to fix the navigation issue with my robot wheel but it was really hard due to the ROS2 being difficult to work with. Getting my robot to connect was very hard which on several occassions couldn't even do at all slowed me down a lot in my work.
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   As I stated last week, trouble shooting is a very important part of this project. As an example, I taught the thing wrong with the wheel of my robot was waveshare board or the motor but infact it was just a wire that wasn't properly cut.
