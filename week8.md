## Accomplishments
   This week I finally got to resolve the mapping issue with the Robot. Along the way I picked some important skills and lessons I will definitly be using in my future projects.
## Results Achieved 
   This week I was able to create a clean map of a room using the Robot with no issues which moved our project once step closer to completion with this prevalent issue solved.
  
## Algorithms Used 
   This week I got to use the LiDAR-SLAM and V-SLAM algorithms with the robot because the delaying issues were resolved.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   Finding the solution for the mapping issue with the Robot was one of the most frustrating tasks I've had to workout. I didn't know what was wrogn with the robot or where to start lookign for what was wrong with the robot because on the surface everything seemed right. Thankfuly I had a comparison working robot to compare mine to. That robot followed the same documentation as our robot did the only difference was that that one worked and after intensive troube shooting we were able to figure out that it was the motors and the wires that were faulty. 
   I recall mentioning wire issues in the earlier weeks and saying that they were solved but in reality the fact that my wheels were finally working didn't mean the wire issues were solved. I didn't pay as much attention as I should have on the odometry issues because I had already gone over that, which was my biggest mistake because in fact the main issue with the robot was odometry.
my wheels encoders were damaged and the wires where not connected properly and once that was resolved the robot started working properly again.
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   The main lesson I got from this week was to tripple check everything and not bar anything out based on assumptions alone. I could have saved myself so much time if only I had taken the time to go over my wires and motors again but because I had made the assumption that it couldn't possibly be that, I was put in a sittuation where I tried to replace different parts of my robot that weren't relevant to the underlying issue of the robot.
