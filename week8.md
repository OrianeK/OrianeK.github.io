## Accomplishments
   This week my whole time was dedicated to finding a solution to the LiDAR mapping issue that is going on. In that regard I researched and Learned about different techniques to fix the LiDAR.
## Results Achieved 
    Although the LiDAR issue is still prevalent, I got to get familiar with multiple troubleshooting and testing techniques for LiDAR.
  
## Algorithms Used 
   This week I got to use the SLAM algorithm with my robot.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   ALthough I got to run SLAM with my robot I couldn't get a good map because of what is most likely a software issue with SLAM. To resolve this I tried a couple ways the most recent one being re-flashing the SD card as a way to start over which didn't work so this task will definetly transfer over next week
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   I gained a lot of insight on the importance of consistency. Up until this week I hadn't had a problem where I had absolutly no idea what the cause could be which made finding the solution for them less frustrating. Trying to not give up when you're frustated at a problem is really hard but that is how most solutions are found so I think this a very valuable lesson I'm learning form this experience.
