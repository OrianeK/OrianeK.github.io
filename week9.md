## Accomplishments
   This week was a lighter week for me I mainly worked on the delivrables of the project and the slide presentations.
## Results Achieved 
   I was able to complete the LiDAR-SLAM implementation part of the project and slides which meant I could help out the other group members.
  
## Algorithms Used 
   This week no algorithms were used as I was mainly working on my delivrables for the institute.
## Issues and Frustrations Encountered
   Technical writing is not my strongest talent so I needed help to know how I was to format my writing and finding what should be included. Reading other papers for this peoject certianly helped a lot but putting things learned to practice is always a little difficult.
## Other Relevant Experiences or Insights Gained During This Week
   This week I turly learned the importance of being able to properly communicate your findings and results to an audience through writing. The writing part of this project which I was dreading turned out to be one of my more enjoyable parts of this project so everything turned out good.
